# Beirul

This repository is being used as a practice mechanism to test myself on my
knowledge of javascript, css and html.

The Beirul project is meant to be a wiki of sort for a fantasy world, based on
the popular role playing game Dungeons & Dragons. The world of Beirul, is a
creation of my own, but I have used some artwork from the internet, because this
is just a practice project.

The project at the moment consist of 4 different pages at the moment.

1.Index.html (About)
2.history.html (History)
3. geography.html (Geography)
4. Politics (not yet completed)
