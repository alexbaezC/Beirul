      <h2>An Overview of Beirul</h2>
      <p>
        The world of Beirul contains two large continent separated by vast
        oceans. The two large continents of Beirul are Bralea and Cahuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bralea is the home continent of the elves and humans, but that was
        thousands of years ago. In present time only humans leave on Bralea
        as well as dragons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cahuts is a continent were most of it landmass is located in the
        southern hemisphere of Beirul, with the north of the continent being
        the most tropical and swap like area. Elves, humans, orcs, merfolks,
        dragons and liches inhabit the main land and shores of Cahuts, since
        most were driven out by the human empires, by force or because they
        were to primitives for the elves.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment the continent of Cahuts is divided into different
        territories. The orcs on the south west boardering the sea of Galog,
        next to the Fae Iles. The elves hold most of the south eastern
        peninsula until the wild gates. Their 2 main cities are Wyvernpond and
        Silver Haven, the later being the capital of the elven empire. From the
        north of the Sea of Galog until the boarders of the lost desert those
        are the human colonies from the empire of western Bralea. They are the
        new humans in Cahuts and have been there for about a century. The north
        west part of Cahuts are the domains of the necromancers, humans who fled
        persecution 852 years before the present time because their dark
        practices, they are lead by the "Great Lich King." On the north eastern
        part of the island we can find a single tower called the Astral tower
        and abandon ruins of acient civilation. There is a village, near the
        border of the domains of the Great Lich King, that serves as remote
        location for those who go up and down the mountains in the area, this
        village is home to some people sent away for temporary banishment or to
        work there to pay for their crimes. The village also serves as a trading
        outpust and a resting place for adventures. Also there are some farmers,
        normaly marginalised mixed races trying to get away from their own
        cultures for discriminating against them, some of those villagers are
        tiefling, elf-orcs and some humans.
      </p>

      <p>
        The land of Cahuts full of ruins and also wild jungles that are full of
        mazes, that hold artifacts of tremendous power or treasures of great
        value. Begining from the wild gates, no one knows what you can find but
        there are rumors that on the biggest island of this wild you can find
        the 3 wild gods, who will grant you one request, within their power if
        you prove yourselves and get to meet each one of them. There are island
        rule by dragons, fairies and cover in snow, but no one really knows what
        is on them.
      </p>
